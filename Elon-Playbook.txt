**Elon Musk: First Principles Approach In Design**

**First Principles Thinking:**

*Break down complex problems into fundamental truths*
- Question every assumption and conventional wisdom
- Ask "What are we absolutely certain is true?"
- Rebuild solutions from the ground up, not by analogy

*Challenge the artificial constraints*
- Most constraints are human-made, not physics-based
- If somethingâ€™s never been done, ask "Why not?"
- Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation

**The DFX Method (Design for X):**

*Design for Cost (DFC)*
- Start with the target cost as a hard constraint
- Work backwards from market price to required cost
- Eliminate unnecessary components and complexity
- Question every dollar in the bill of materials
- Design out costs before they're designed in

*Design for Manufacturing (DFM)*
- Design parts that can be manufactured at scale
- Minimize number of steps in manufacturing process
- Reduce assembly time and complexity
- Consider factory layout and automation from the start
- Make it robot-friendly - design for automated assembly

*Design for Simple (DFS)*
- Reduce part count aggressively
- Combine functions into single parts where possible
- Eliminate unnecessary features and complexity
- Make assembly intuitive and fool-proof
- If a part isn't absolutely necessary, remove it

*Design for Production Rate (DFPR)*
- Design with production speed in mind
- Consider throughput at every step
- Eliminate bottlenecks before they occur
- Plan for exponential production growth
- Make cycle time reduction a key metric'
